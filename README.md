- Gazebo simulation models for different LiDAR sensors (Velodyne, Ouster, ...). This is a customized version of an open-source repo originally developed by [Dataspeed](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/velodyne_simulator).
- The lidar model could be selected using following names: VLP-16, HDL-32E,O1-64

### Todo:
- Add O1-16, O0-128.

### Known issues:
- Option with GPU might not work: check this [note](https://github.com/tungdanganh/velodyne_simulator/blob/master/gazebo_upgrade.md)
